                Doctor Elvira Almazan has been a dentist for more than three decades, with a thriving practice she has nurtured and built from the ground up.
                In 1978, she graduated from the University of the East in the Top 10 of the Dental Board Exams and obtained her post-graduate degrees in dental surgery from Taiwan and New York in 2010. Initially starting as a corporate dentist for Philacor, she eventually started her own clinic in 1982 making a name for herself as a hardworking, reliable corporate dentist.
